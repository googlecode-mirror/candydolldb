# History #

Once upon a time, in a land perhaps closer than you think, there was a programmer. He regularly thought up projects in PHP and MySQL which would force him to familiarize himself with all the ins and outs he thought existed. Boy, was he in for a surprise... At work, he programmed in C# (.NET framework), strictly [Object Oriented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) - could this be done in PHP, too?

After about two weeks of thinking it over, he needed a subject around which to build his new project. CandyDoll sprang to mind. After searching the internet for an existing application, and finding none, he decided [CandyDollDB](http://code.google.com/p/candydolldb/) had to be built. The preset goal would be to comfortably manage that vast collection of CandyDoll images and videos through a web-interface.

Then finally, one sunny sunday morning, the programmer thought of Google Code. He decided he would start a project for his application. This was (and is) a completely new learning-curve. How does one write comprehensible documentation? How does one anticipate the users' needs and wants? Are there actually any people out there who would benefit from this application?

I hope, the answer to that last question is YES. The fact that you are reading this page right now proves just that. :-)

Of course, collecting the actual content is as much fun as programming the interface: Browsing usenet, forums and the official [CandyDoll](http://www.candydoll.tv/)-site for that latest (or lost) bit of info about models, sets or collections.

Please enjoy CandyDollDB and your CandyDoll-collection, see you soon.
